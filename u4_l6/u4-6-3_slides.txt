Title Slide (Topic 4.5): A blue slide displaying the title "TOPIC 4.5 Conditional Probability" with an AP Statistics logo. Note: This slide appears briefly before the video content switches to the correct topic title.

00:04 - 00:20
Title Slide (Topic 4.6): The correct title slide for the lesson appears: "TOPIC 4.6 Independent Events and Unions of Events." It lists this as "Daily Video 3" and summarizes the video's goal: reviewing key ideas/formulas and applying them to a free-response question.

00:21 - 00:23
Section Header: A blue slide with the text "WHAT WILL WE LEARN?"

00:24 - 00:38
Learning Objectives: A white slide listing two learning goals:

Distinguishing questions involving conditional vs. unconditional probabilities.

Determining which probability formula to use and when.

00:39 - 00:44
Section Header: A white slide titled "Probability Recap."

00:45 - 01:13
Probability Recap (Basic Definitions): The slide lists bullet points:

The formula for probability (Number of outcomes in E / Total outcomes in sample space).

The rule that probability is a number between 0 and 1.

The complement rule: 
𝑃
(
not 
𝐸
)
=
1
−
𝑃
(
𝐸
)
P(not E)=1−P(E)
.

01:14 - 01:22
Probability Recap (Interpretation): A bullet point explaining that probability is interpreted as the long-run relative frequency of an event occurring over many repetitions.

01:23 - 01:34
Probability Recap (Mutually Exclusive): A bullet point defining mutually exclusive (disjoint) events and stating that their intersection 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
0
P(A∩B)=0
.

01:35 - 01:52
Probability Recap (Conditional Probability): A bullet point defining conditional probability. It displays the formula:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∣B)=
P(B)
P(A∩B)
	​


01:53 - 02:05
Probability Recap (Intersection): A bullet point showing the general multiplication rule:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
⋅
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B∣A)

02:06 - 02:27
Probability Recap (Independence): Bullet points listing the rules that apply only if events are independent:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
P(A∣B)=P(A)

𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(B∣A)=P(B)

𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
⋅
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B)

02:28 - 02:40
Probability Recap (Union): A bullet point showing the general addition rule for the union of two events:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∪
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
+
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
−
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)

02:41 - 02:45
Section Header: A blue slide with the text "LET'S LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE."

02:46 - 02:58
Example Data: A slide titled "What's the News?" displaying a two-way contingency table titled "Highest Level of Educational Achievement." It compares education levels (rows) against primary news sources (columns) for a sample of 2,500 adults.

02:59 - 04:05
Part (a) Calculation: The slide displays the data table and question (a), asking for the probability of selecting a college graduate OR someone who uses the internet.

03:14: A sidebar defines Event A (College Grad) and Event B (Internet).

03:30: The addition formula is displayed.

03:56: The numerical calculation is shown: 
1135
2500
=
0.454
2500
1135
	​

=0.454
.

04:06 - 04:59
Part (b) Calculation: The slide displays the data table and question (b), asking for the probability that a selected college graduate obtains news from the internet.

04:36: The "College Graduate" column is highlighted in a blue box.

04:38: The conditional formula is shown.

04:59: The result is calculated: 
245
693
=
0.354
693
245
	​

=0.354
.

05:00 - 05:27
Comparison of Wording: A slide contrasting the wording of question (a) and (b).

(a) highlights "an adult is to be selected" (Sample space = entire sample).

(b) highlights "an adult who is a college graduate is to be selected" (Sample space = college graduates only).

05:28 - 06:23
Part (c) Independence Check (Method 1): The slide asks if the events are independent.

It compares 
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
P(B∣A)
 (from Part b) to 
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(B)
 (unconditional probability of using the internet).

It shows that 
0.354
≠
0.2748
0.354

=0.2748
, concluding they are not independent.

06:24 - 06:50
Part (c) Independence Check (Method 2): An alternative method is shown on the slide.

It compares the intersection 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
P(A∩B)
 to the product 
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
⋅
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A)⋅P(B)
.

It shows that 
0.098
≠
0.076
0.098

=0.076
, confirming they are not independent.

06:51 - 06:52
Section Header: A blue slide with the text "WHAT SHOULD WE TAKE AWAY?"

06:53 - 07:16
Key Takeaways: A white slide listing three summary points:

Conditional probabilities can be calculated from two-way tables by selecting specific rows/columns.

If 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
P(A∣B)=P(A)
, the events are independent.

The union formula: 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∪
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
+
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
−
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)
.
