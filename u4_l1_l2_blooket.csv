13,"In probability, what does INDEPENDENT mean for coin flips?","Knowing one flip's result does not change the probability of the next","Each flip has a different probability based on previous results","The outcomes must alternate between heads and tails","Consecutive flips are more likely to show the same result",20,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"When knowing the result of one trial does not affect the probability of future trials, the trials are called:","Dependent","Mutually Exclusive","Conditional","Independent",20,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"After flipping 5 tails in a row, what is the probability the next flip is heads?","50% - each flip is independent of previous flips","Greater than 50% - heads is now more likely","Less than 50% - the streak will probably continue","100% - heads is guaranteed after so many tails",20,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
