# Gradebook Phase 2 — cr-quiz GRADE-feeder rollup (frozen contract)

**Status:** Contract frozen 2026-05-19 (session 100, autonomous loop task #2).
Depends on: Task #1 (T2 skill-map merged — `4140afe`), DN2d (cr-quiz
write-path LIVE in cr-repo `1ccd8a2`), Sprint 1 (`item_ledger` LIVE).
Reads: `GRADEBOOK_GRADING_SPEC.md` v2 §2, `GRADEBOOK_SPEC.md` §8,
cr-repo `DN2D_BUILD.md`, `CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md` task #2.

## 1. What Phase 2 is (and is NOT)

DN2d already **writes** every cr-quiz answer to `item_ledger`
(`source='curriculum_quiz'`, `item_id`=verbatim curriculum.js question id,
`response`=selected option(s), `attempt`, **`score` deliberately OMITTED** —
"done = attempted, not score-gated"; correctness deferred to the rollup).

**Phase 2 = the grade-of-record aggregation/rollup side:** score each
cr-quiz `response` against the answer key and aggregate into a per-student
per-unit **correctness-weighted cr-quiz feeder contribution** — one of the
two feeders of `B(unit)` in v2 §2's cumulative+capped model.

**NOT Phase 2 (= Phase 3):** combining the two feeders into `B(unit)`,
`banked=min(B,C≈85)`, `unitGrade=max(banked,P)`, the diagnostic BKT. Phase 2
only produces the cr-quiz feeder rollup that Phase 3 consumes.

## 2. The answer-key problem + decision (proven bundled-data pattern)

The correct-answer key lives in **sacred `curriculum_render/data/curriculum.js`**
(cr repo, 1.7MB, READ-ONLY) — the deployed roster-server (Root Dir =
`roster-server/`) cannot reach it. **Decision: a read-only extraction
bundled into roster-server**, exactly mirroring the DN2-prep precedent that
bundled `work-manifest.json` so `/donow` survives redeploy.

- **`scripts/build-answer-key.mjs`** — reads `../curriculum_render/data/curriculum.js`
  **READ-ONLY** (never writes it; `new Function` extract like
  `disambiguate-skills.mjs` / `build-skill-map.mjs`). Emits, for each
  objectively-scorable MCQ item: `{ [questionId]: { answerKey, type,
  unit, topic } }`. FRQ / free-response items (no objective key) are
  **excluded** (recorded in a count; they are the AI-graded follow-along
  feeder's job, not cr-quiz auto-scoring). Dual-write (DN2-prep pattern):
  `data/answer-key.json` + byte-identical bundled
  `roster-server/data/answer-key.json`. id namespace == work-manifest /
  skill-map keys (DN2d proved all 817 cr ids match verbatim → 0 mapping).
- **SACRED guard:** `git diff` must show `curriculum.js` untouched; the
  script only reads. (Honors `feedback_curriculum_render_sacred.md`.)

## 3. roster-server rollup (server-mediated, §6.5)

- New module `roster-server/rollup.js`, mounted in `server.js` (additive,
  pattern-match `mountLedger`/`mountDonow`; injectable `ledger-db` + the
  bundled answer-key; no network in tests).
- **`GET /rollup?token=` (roster-token auth, like `/donow`)** → for the
  authenticated student:
  1. Load `curriculum_quiz` rows from `item_ledger` (their rows only).
  2. Per `item_id`: take the **latest attempt**; score
     `response` vs bundled `answerKey` → correct ∈ {0,1}. Items with no
     key entry (FRQ / unknown) → excluded from the score denominator
     (counted as `ungradable`).
  3. Aggregate per **unit**: `{ unit: { attempted, graded, correct,
     crQuizPct (0–100 = correct/graded*100, null if graded=0) } }`.
  4. Return `{ ok, asOf, units: {...}, totals }`. **No grade math** (that's
     Phase 3) — purely the cr-quiz feeder rollup.
- `response` shape tolerance: DN2d records the selected option; scorer
  normalizes (string vs {value} vs array) and compares case/space-insensitive
  to the extracted key. Defensive: never throw on a malformed row → that
  row is `ungradable`, rollup continues.
- **Read-only** w.r.t. `item_ledger` (no writes; never mutates DN2d rows).

## 4. Acceptance (GREEN for this loop task)

- `node scripts/build-answer-key.mjs` → `data/answer-key.json` +
  `roster-server/data/answer-key.json` byte-identical;
  **`git diff ../curriculum_render/data/curriculum.js` empty** (sacred).
- New `tests/answer-key.test.js` (extraction: sacred-untouched, ids ⊆
  work-manifest keys, FRQ excluded, deterministic) + roster-server
  `tests/rollup.test.js` (fixture ledger → expected per-unit pct; latest
  attempt wins; ungradable excluded; malformed row tolerated; auth gate;
  read-only) all green.
- roster-server full suite stays green (Phase-0/1 + donow regression);
  `npm test` root suite: only the 1 known `study-guide.test.js` fail.
- `audit-feeder-ids` CLEAN 69 (unchanged — Phase 2 adds no skill-map keys).
- roster-server **REAL redeploy** (new endpoint + bundled answer-key):
  `cd roster-server && railway up --ci -s roster`; smoke `/health` +
  `/rollup` with a SMOKETEST account (enroll → record a known
  `curriculum_quiz` row → `/rollup` returns the expected pct); clean up
  via the standing `delete from roster where section='SMOKETEST';`.

## 5. Method (loop algorithm)

Contract frozen (this doc) → **planner implements directly** (cohesive
multi-file but interdependent server tooling; parallel-Sonnet = clobber
risk) → Codex cross-agent **read-only review** (ASCII-only; parse
`state/cross-agent/<id>.result.json`) → planner re-verify on disk (suites +
guards + the live smoke) → tight commit (stage own paths only; cr repo
NOT touched — extraction is read-only, no cr commit) → push → **real
roster-server redeploy** + smoke → Task #3 (Phase 3).

**Guardrails:** never write `curriculum.js` (sacred — read-only extract
only); roster-server changes are additive (no Phase-0/1/donow regression);
EOL LF for roster-server + bundled json; stage only own paths (this repo
has unrelated dirty scratch).
