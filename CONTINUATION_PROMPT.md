# Continuation Prompt — TI-84 CE Procedural Trainer

**Last updated**: 2026-04-09
**Status**: V3 functional end-to-end — CEmu primary, native state machine, clutch system, auto-fill
**Deadline**: ~May 7 (AP exam, 28 days out)

---

## What This Project Is

A standalone single-file HTML webapp that trains AP Statistics students on the **mechanical key-press sequences** for every TI-84 Plus CE procedure used across Units 1-9. Students interact with a real CEmu-emulated calculator (ROM via Supabase), while a native JS state machine validates keystrokes and drives guided walkthroughs. SRS scheduling ensures durable memory.

## Architecture (V3 — Current)

```
Student clicks virtual key
  → Native state machine: "Is this the right key?"
  → If correct: pass to CEmu → LCD renders real calculator screen
  → If wrong: blocked, show feedback
  → Clutch system: can pause guidance to fix errors freely

ROM loaded from Supabase bucket → cached in IndexedDB → never re-downloaded
Calculator resets to HOME on every new problem
```

### Key Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| CEmu WASM (`wasm/WebCEmu.js + .wasm`) | Runs real TI-84 ROM in browser, renders LCD |
| Native module (`native/*.js`, 9 files) | State machine, stat math, menu nav, form engine |
| Bridge (`bridge.js`) | CEmu interface + Supabase ROM auto-loader |
| App (`app.js`) | Walkthrough engine, clutch, SRS, UI |
| Procedures data (`ti84-procedures-data.json`) | 27 procedures, 384+ steps, 65 screens |

### Clutch System (3-phase walkthrough)

```
Phase 1: DATA SETUP (clutch disengaged)
  - Auto-fill types data into CEmu lists/matrices
  - Or student enters manually, clicks "I'm done"
  - 12 of 27 procedures need this phase

Phase 2: PROCEDURE (clutch engaged)
  - State machine validates keystrokes
  - Guided mode: highlights next key, blocks wrong keys
  - Recall mode: no highlights, hints count as misses
  - Pause button: disengage mid-procedure to fix errors

Phase 3: RESULT REVIEW (clutch disengaged)
  - Free exploration of result screen
```

| `ti84-v3-spec.md` | V3 architecture (CEmu primary + native state machine) |

## Key Design Decisions (Already Made)

1. **CEmu is primary UI** — students see the real emulated calculator, not a mid-fidelity mock
2. **Native module is the state machine** — validates keystrokes, tracks screen state, never renders to LCD
3. **ROM from Supabase** — auto-download, IndexedDB cache, no file picker. URL: `https://bzqbhtrurzzavhqbgqrs.supabase.co`, bucket: `ti84-trainer-assets`
4. **Clutch system** — disengage/engage state machine for data setup, error correction, result review
5. **Auto-fill** — trainer types sample data into CEmu lists/matrices via key presses
6. **ALPHA + key for menu letters** — items A-H in TESTS/DISTR menus require ALPHA then the physical key
7. **Calculator skin** — matches physical TI-84 Plus CE EZ-Spot model (charcoal body, yellow bezel, blue 2nd, green alpha)
8. **Reset on every problem** — both CEmu and native reset to HOME before each walkthrough
9. **List memory** — persists in localStorage, always shows data setup phase (never silently skips)
10. **CEmu global stubs** — `emul_is_inited`, `initFuncs`, `initLCD`, `enableGUI`, `disableGUI` defined before `callMain()`
11. **`.gitattributes`** — marks `.wasm`, `.rom`, `.8xv`, `.8xp`, `.sqlite` as binary (prevents CRLF corruption)

## Known Issues / Remaining Work

### Layout
- Calculator skin works but is large — at 100% zoom on 1366x768, user may need to scroll to see full keypad
- Previous attempts to auto-fit viewport height (clamp/flex) made LCD too small or keys unreadable
- D-pad arrows have minor jitter on click (`:active` transform conflicts with positioning)

### Procedures
- All 27 procedures verified via automated tests (354 passing, 0 discrepancies)
- Auto-fill navigation fixed (quits to home and re-enters STAT>EDIT per list)
- Letter key steps split into ALPHA + physical key (7 procedures)
- Color: field steps added to 6 draw-capable wizards

### Not Yet Built
- **Deployment** — GitHub Pages (private repo, may need Pro) or Vercel or Netlify
- **Student pilot testing** — need real students running through procedures
- **Mobile layout** — not optimized for phones/tablets
- **Graph rendering** — native module has mock graphs; CEmu shows real graphs
- **STAT>EDIT data entry walkthrough** — could be its own guided procedure teaching list entry

## Commands

```bash
# Run native module tests
cd ti84-trainer-v2/native && npx vitest run --config vitest.config.js

# Rebuild standalone.html after changes to app.js/style.css/data

## Previous Context Chain

1-32: [See previous CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md — ROM research, Codex data gathering, verification, V1, V2]
33. Tested V2 standalone in browser — fixed CRLF corruption (.gitattributes), CEmu global stubs
34. CEmu boots successfully with real ROM in browser
35. Built verification app (ti84-verify.html) — step-through certification with discrepancy tracking
36. ROM disassembly spec + Codex prompt — targeted eZ80 extraction of wizard/result data
37. Codex produced ROM disassembly results — 20 wizards, 14 results, 13 discrepancies
38. Applied ROM findings: Color: field added to 6 wizards, CNTB removed, alt hypothesis labels fixed
39. Integrated ROM confidence into verification app — auto-passed 138 high-confidence steps
40. Corrected keypad layout from Gemini photo comparison — 6-column grid, D-pad cross
41. Built native TI-84 stat module — 5 Codex agents in 3 parallel batches, 276 tests
42. Automated procedure verification — found 13 step mismatches, fixed all, 354 tests 0 discrepancies
43. V3 integration — CEmu primary, native validates, Supabase ROM, calculator skin
44. Fixed hover jitter (brightness instead of translateY) and letter key selection (physicalKey mapping)
45. Layout fix attempts — multiple rounds, ultimately rolled back to V3 base + boosted 2nd/alpha fonts
46. Fixed ALPHA + key for menu items A-H — split into two steps, added ALPHA handler to native orchestrator
47. Clutch system built — data setup phase, auto-fill for lists/matrices, list memory, pause/resume guidance
48. Fixed auto-fill list navigation (quit-and-reenter per list) and stale memory skip
49. Added pause/resume button for mid-procedure error correction
50. Deployment discussion — GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify. User will decide later.
