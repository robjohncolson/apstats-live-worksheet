## Unit 4: Overview

### Big Idea 1: Variation and Distribution (VAR)
*   How can an event be both random and predictable?

### Big Idea 2: Patterns and Uncertainty (UNC)
*   About how many rolls of a fair six-sided die would we anticipate it taking to get three 1s?

### Developing Understanding
Probabilistic reasoning allows statisticians to quantify the likelihood of random events over the long run and to make statistical inferences. Simulations and concrete examples can help students to understand the abstract definitions and calculations of probability. This unit builds on understandings of simulated or empirical data distributions and fundamental principles of probability to represent, interpret, and calculate parameters for theoretical probability distributions for discrete random variables. Interpretations of probabilities and parameters associated with a probability distribution should use appropriate units and relate to the context of the situation.

### Building Course Skills
**Skills 2.B, 3.A, 3.B, 4.B**

Probability is a notoriously difficult topic for students to grasp because it’s difficult to conceptualize future outcomes in concrete ways. Before introducing new formulas, teachers can help students get an intuitive feel for why the formulas (and related notation) make sense. For example, the probability formulas for $P(A \text{ or } B)$ and for $P(A|B)$ can be presented intuitively with two-way tables. Simulations can also help students internalize what it means to quantify random behavior. To help students understand when to apply different probability rules, teachers can use explicit strategies such as matching verbal scenarios to their corresponding probability formulas.

Students frequently misinterpret probability distributions and parameters for random variables. Teachers can reinforce that a complete interpretation will include context and units. A common misconception later in the course is that every question involving probability requires a significance test. Students should practice making predictions and decisions based on probability alone to avoid this misconception early on. They should revisit these problems in later units to practice differentiating between inference and probability problems.

### Preparing for the AP Exam
To help students prepare for the AP Exam, teachers can model showing all steps in probability calculations and expect students to do the same. Calculations on the AP Exam should include presentation of an appropriate expression that communicates the structure of the formula, substitution of relevant values extracted from the problem, and an answer.

In **2017 FRQ 3**, for example, a student who writes "$P(G) = P(G|J) \cdot P(J) + P(G|K) \cdot P(K) = (0.2119)(0.7) + (0.8413)(0.3) = 0.4007$" has communicated the products in the multiplication rule, the sum in the addition rule, and an understanding that the events are mutually exclusive—all components of a complete response. To avoid a common error, students who present the same work using a tree diagram should practice using probabilities in the diagram correctly. Students importing incorrect solutions from one part of a multipart question to solve another will not be penalized a second time, unless the subsequent result is not a reasonable value (like a probability less than 0 or greater than 1).

## Sample Instructional Activities

| Activity | Topic | Sample Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **4.3, 4.5, 4.8** | **Error Analysis:** Using 2015 FRQ 3, provide students with several answers containing errors for each part. Provide some responses with incorrect notation, incorrect work, missing work, work that shows calculator commands only, an incorrect formula or approach, and an incorrect final answer. Then ask students to identify the errors. |
| **2** | **4.3, 4.5, 4.6** | **Think-Pair-Share:** Provide students with a set of five probability questions: one for the complement rule, the conditional probability formula, the general multiplication rule, the multiplication rule for independent events, and the general addition rule. Ask students to individually identify the formula needed to solve each problem, without doing the final calculations. Then have them share their thoughts with a partner. |
| **3** | **4.5, 4.6** | **Create Representations:** Provide students with the scenario from 2018 FRQ 3. Ask them to create a tree diagram to organize the information in the problem. Then ask them to use the information in the problem to set up a hypothetical 100,000 table (to make the decimals easy to work with). Encourage students to try both representations when solving probability questions in the future. |
| **4** | **4.10, 4.12** | **Odd One Out:** After modeling an odd one out example, have students form groups of four and give each of them a description of either a binomial or a geometric random variable. Explain that three of their variables follow the same probability distribution and one is different. Have students work together in their groups to determine whose is the odd one out and explain why. |
| **5** | **4.2, 4.12** | **Predict and Confirm:** Ask students to consider couples who plan to continue having children until they have one girl and predict how many children they think these couples will have, on average. Then ask each student to perform 10 trials using a coin toss where Heads = Girl and Tails = Boy. A trial is finished once one girl is observed and the number of total children is recorded. Combine the class results and calculate the average. Confirm with the geometric mean formula once it is discussed. |
