-- 0030_quarter_grade_snapshot: freeze a student's quarter grade at teacher-run
-- quarter close (PC makeup [D] freeze/delta). The snapshot is the AUTHORITATIVE
-- closed-quarter record — the teacher enters it into Schoology at close; the live
-- engine keeps recomputing, and post-close improvements surface as BONUS DELTAS
-- (current - frozen). Best-wins-at-write (Phase 2 /pc submit) guarantees the live
-- grade only ever RISES post-close, so a delta is always a positive extra-credit
-- candidate, never a drop the freeze has to shield against.
--
-- Idempotent close: PK(student_id, quarter) + INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
-- (the FIRST close wins — a frozen grade is immutable; re-closing only snapshots
-- students not yet frozen). /class/quarter/* return 503 until this is applied.
