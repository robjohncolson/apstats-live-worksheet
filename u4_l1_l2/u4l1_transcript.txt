The following is a transcript of the provided video:

- [00:00 - 00:15] Hello, my name is Michael Joy on behalf of College Board. In this video, we are looking at topic 4.1, Random and Non-Random Patterns. And we're going to discuss the concept of randomness and how chance behavior may actually appear to be non-random.
- [00:15 - 00:30] So, what will we learn? We're going to learn what a random process is. And we're going to also talk about how seemingly non-random patterns may actually be a result of a random process.
- [00:30 - 01:03] From headlines to sports to questions to anomalies to everyday life, randomness shows up in our readings, in what we discuss, in what we look at when we see on TV. This notion of chance at work in the world around us is something that's engaged mathematicians, engaged statisticians for years and years. And so, we want to talk a little bit more about these random processes.
- [01:03 - 01:27] And so, what is a random process? That is something where we are aware of the possible outcomes, but we are not aware or we have no idea what the individual outcome will be. We know all the possibilities, but we don't know what an actual outcome will be. Alright. And again, this is called a random process. Individual outcomes are uncertain, but there is a sense of predictability that occurs in the long run.
- [01:27 - 01:54] Alright. So, real quick, I want you to do something for me. I call this, Give It a Chance. I want you to write down, take pause the video right here, write down a sequence of 100 flips that you think could come from a fair coin. Do not actually flip a coin, do not use a computer or anything like that, but just write down a sequence of heads and tails that you think could come from a fair coin.
- [01:54 - 02:14] Alright. Now that you have done that, how many heads did your coin result in? And how many tails? What I'm also interested in is, what is the longest streak of heads or tails recorded by your coin?
- [02:14 - 02:44] Alright. So, now, I did not write down this sequence, I actually went and flipped a coin 100 times and got this following sequence of heads and tails. Alright. So, we're just going to look through here. Is there any indication that this coin that I used was unfair, that my way of flipping was somehow unfair? And actually, no it wasn't. If we go through and count, we see that we had 51 heads, 49 tails, which is close, pretty close to an expected 50-50 outcome.
- [02:44 - 03:17] Did I notice any patterns in the sequence flips? No, not really. It was just this almost haphazard set of heads and tails throughout this entire sequence of flips. And is it possible for me to determine what my next flip is? Alright. And that's something I need us to watch out for as we go along this unit, the notion of hey, being able to anticipate what the next thing is, and the answer is no. The next flip cannot be determined.
- [03:17 - 03:52] Now, there was something else that caught my attention when I did this and I want you to kind of help me out with this. In the first five flips, we noticed that it was all tails. Is this any type of indication that the next flip needs to be a heads? Alright. Just to let you know, the answer is no. It did so happen that the next one was a heads, alright, but it was not, it was not because I was due for a heads.
- [03:52 - 04:15] Alright. And it's something else that we notice in this, the longest streak that I had was eight. So, I might be interested in how likely is it to get a string of either eight heads or eight tails within a set of 100 rolls. Alright. Eight in a row, that seems to be a lot. Alright.
- [04:15 - 04:43] So, looking at yours, how truly random was your set of random flips? What was your longest run? Actually believe it or not, that set of eight tails that we got may not be as weird as you may think. Even though we had eight in a row, that may actually be a little more likely than what you may expect. So, should we be surprised? Check out the next video and we're going to talk some more about it.
- [04:43 - 05:18] So, what should we take away from this video? A random process is a situation where all the possible outcomes that can occur are known, but individual outcomes are unknown. And again, we'll speak to this some more in later videos. And patterns of random occurrences may include strings or runs of outcomes that appear to be non-random, such as our string of eight tails in a row. So, I hope this video was helpful. Thanks for watching and have a great day.
