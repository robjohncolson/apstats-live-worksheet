A transcription of the video is as follows:
- **00:00 - 00:17**: Hey, this is Joshua Soria on behalf of the College Board. And in this video, we're looking at Topic 4.2 Estimating Probabilities using Simulation, Video 2. And we're going to introduce the law of large numbers and also show how to use simulation to estimate probabilities.
- **00:17 - 00:29**: So as we stated, we're going to talk about what the law of large numbers is and we're going to also talk about how simulation can be used to estimate probabilities.
- **00:29 - 01:10**: The law of large numbers says that simulated probabilities seem to get closer to the true probability as the number of trials increases. All right, so I want to look at an example. We simulated this "fair" coin and I want you all to keep in mind whether or not you think this coin is fair as we do this. And I have a set of 10 flips: heads, heads, tails, heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, heads, tails. So as of now, do you think that this coin is fair? All right, and one way we can tell is by counting these probabilities as we continue on.
- **01:10 - 02:04**: So if we looked at our first trial, we see that we were one out of one for a heads. For the second trial, we were two out of two and so on for our first 10 flips. All right, so our first 10 flips were 6 out of 10. We then "quote" flip 10 more times and okay, so still maybe you know, around the 60%. Okay. So then we flip 10 more times. Well, we talked in the couple of videos ago that there is a likelihood of having some streaks, so okay, we feel okay about that. Okay, we flip 10 more times. We flip 10 more times and then we continue to flip until we get 1,000 flips. So with this being said, do you think that this coin is a fair coin? Hmm.
- **02:04 - 02:38**: As stated, the law of large numbers tells us that our simulated probability gets closer and closer to a theoretical probability. So for this coin, we can say that our theoretical probability maybe that is a 80% chance of a heads, so this coin definitely would not be fair. All right, the law of large numbers says also that as the number of trials increases, the variability from that true probability is decreased.
- **02:38 - 03:05**: So now let's go and talk about how we can conduct a simulation. First of all, we have to use some sort of chance device to imitate this random process: whether it's cards, whether it's dice, whether it's using coins, whether it's using a table of random digits, whether it's using a random number generator. So in our age of technology, I do want to talk a little bit about how we can use a random number generator and our steps will be as followed.
- **03:05 - 03:37**: First of all, we have to describe how the random digits will imitate the trial, in essence what digits or what numbers will be used to represent which outcomes. And also determine what will be recorded from each trial. We then perform many, many, many trials of the simulation and then we're going to calculate the relative frequency of successful trials in order to get a simulated probability.
- **03:37 - 04:05**: So let's look at an example and we call this Sharpshooter! All right, you can take a minute to read that. In essence, we have a member of the basketball team who makes 82% of their free throw shots. And at the end of their practice, each player must shoot free throw shots until they miss and in order to break the record she must make 16 consecutive shots and so we want to design a simulation to determine the likelihood of this record being broken.
- **04:05 - 05:10**: So in order to use a random number generator to perform this simulation, the first thing we have to do is we have to assign digits to represent those outcomes. All right, and again this has to be such that the probabilities of our random numbers are in alignment with the actual probabilities of her making these shots. So we can represent the numbers from 1 to 82, those will represent a made shot and the numbers from 83 to 100 can represent a missed shot. We can then use a random number generator to obtain a number between 1 and 100 and we will continue to select numbers until a shot is missed. Because each number represents the outcome of a single shot, it's okay to have repeats. All right, and we are going to count the number of made shots and then we can repeat this for several trials and we can calculate the overall proportion of trials where at least 16 consecutive shots were made.
- **05:10 - 06:08**: Now, some of you in your classes you may not be using random number generators on a computer, you may actually still be using a table of random digits, so this is a similar process but is a couple differences. If we're going to use a table of random digits, we must ensure that we assign two-digit numbers to represent the shots. So instead of just looking at the number 1, we would call that 01 so we can say from 01 to 82 represent a made shot and then from 83 to 99 along with 00 can represent a missed shot. Then when we look at our table of random digits, we will select digits two at a time moving from left to right. Um, and then because each number represents the outcome of a shot, it's okay to have repeats. We would continue selecting two-digit numbers until a shot is missed or until in this case we select a number from between 83 to 99 or 00. Count the number of made shots, repeat for several trials and again calculate the proportion of trials with at least 16 consecutive shots made.
- **06:08 - 07:16**: All right. I generated some random digits and in my first trial we had the shots, we had the numbers 26, 63 and 87. So that represented two made shots. In the next trial, we had a 15 and a 91 so that represented one made shot. All right. Next trial one made shot. Next trial four made shots and so on and so on and so on. So in our first eight trials, we did not have any trials where she was able to break the record of 16 shots. All right, now because of technology, we were able to do this 200 times and we could have kept going because of advances in technology and computers and everything but this still takes a while. And if you were to go and count the number of times that we see 16 or more made shots, you would see that out of our 200 trials, this actually happens 13 times. And again, this is just for our set of 200 trials. If we were to do another set of 200 trials then we should expect to get a different set of outcomes.
- **07:16 - 07:49**: But our conclusion for right now we can say that out of the 200 trials, 13 resulted in a streak of 16 or more made shots. So the estimated or the simulated probability of the shooter breaking the record would be 13 out of 200, which is 6.5%. Now, how can we determine the probability of an event without having to do simulations? How can we actually calculate theoretical or actual probabilities? Stay tuned to the next video and we'll have a conversation about that as well.
- **07:49 - 08:27**: All right. So what should we take away? As the number of trials of a random process increases, the probability tends to get closer, the simulated probability tends to get closer to the true probability and this is called the law of large numbers. And also simulation involves using a chance device to perform many trials of a random process and the relative frequency of a particular outcome or an event is an estimate of its probability. I hope this video was helpful. Thanks for watching and have a great day.
